This was a 'downstream', essentially compatible, version of flask-sqlalchemy that
removed legacy code servicing Flask versions < 0.9 and Sqlalchemy versions < 0.7

Development is stopped and was mainly a learning experience for creating and maintaining
a package. Any differences from flask-sqlalchemy have been committed to flask-sqlalchemy
main branch. As an exercise in forking, modifying, and tweaking an existing package,
the squll branch can now be found here:

http://github.com/thrisp/flask-sqlalchemy

select squll branch from dropdown, if squll is not immediately visible.

Use is parallel to usage of flask-sqlalchemy, using 'squll' and 'Squll' respectively.
