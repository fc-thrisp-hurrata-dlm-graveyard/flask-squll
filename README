This is a 'downstream', essentially compatible, version of flask-sqlalchemy that removes legacy code servicing Flask versions < 0.9 and Sqlalchemy versions < 0.7.

To install the latest version:

    pip install flask-squll

Use is parallel to usage of flask-sqlalchemy, using 'squll' and 'Squll' respectively.
